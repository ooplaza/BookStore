There are four steps for adding a custom user model to our project:
1. Create a CustomUser model
2. Update django_project/settings.py
3. Customize UserCreationForm and UserChangeForm
4. Add the custom user model to admin.py

We also want to add a AUTH_USER_MODEL config at the bottom of the file
which will cause our project to use CustomUser instead of the default User model.


Sign Up
Implementing a sign up page for user registration is completely up to us. We’ll go through the
standard steps for any new page:
• create an app-level accounts/urls.py file
• update the project-level django_project/urls.py to point to the accounts app
• add a view called SignupPageView
• create a signup.html template file
• update home.html to display the sign up page
