""" Both are used to check if they are authenticated. """

When rendering a template RequestContext,
the currently logged-in user, either a User instance or an AnonymousUser instance, is stored in the template variable {{ user }}:

1. request.user --> Used when creating, updating and deleting this will determine if the object to be created is valid
2. user --> Used when checking if authenticated.
